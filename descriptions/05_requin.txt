Researchers at the University of Florida have developed a non-polluting antifouling coating inspired by shark skin. Similarly, ALPhANOV has developed, as part of the European TresClean project, a laser texturing process aimed at creating biological anti-contamination surfaces on metal molds used to manufacture composite parts for washing machines.
