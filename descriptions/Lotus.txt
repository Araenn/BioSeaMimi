Self-cleaning surfaces: Materials mimicking the lotus effect can be used to create self-cleaning surfaces for buildings, vehicles, and textiles. This reduces the need for manual cleaning and maintenance.

Anti-icing surfaces: The superhydrophobic properties of lotus-inspired materials can prevent ice formation by repelling water. This has applications in designing surfaces for aircraft, power lines, and other structures in cold climates.

Biomedical applications: Lotus-inspired surfaces have been explored for biomedical applications, such as creating water-repellent coatings for medical devices and implants. This can help prevent the adhesion of biological substances and improve device performance.

Anti-corrosion coatings: By preventing water from adhering to surfaces, lotus-inspired coatings can inhibit corrosion. This is particularly useful for metal surfaces exposed to humid or corrosive environments.

Textiles: Lotus-inspired fabrics can be used to create water-resistant and stain-resistant clothing. This has practical applications in outdoor gear, sportswear, and everyday apparel
