A bio-inspired hybrid technological approach developed by researchers coordinated by the European Institute of Membranes in Montpellier allows for desalting three times more seawater and consuming 12% less electricity for each treated water cube. Using the highly selective transport of matter from one side to the other of the cell membrane, synthetic compounds that form pores permeable to water molecules, while rejecting ions, have been developed.
