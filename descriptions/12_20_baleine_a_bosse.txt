When contemplating methods to diminish drag or enhance lift, the common mental image often involves the sleek surfaces of airplanes. However, researchers stumbled upon a counterintuitive revelation when examining the bumps on humpback whale fins. The biomimetic model flippers derived from these observations not only decreased drag by 33% but also increased lift by 8%.
Whale Power in Canada has already incorporated these insights into their wind turbines, resulting in a remarkable efficiency boost of over 40% compared to traditional wind turbines in some cases. This innovative approach is not limited to wind turbines; it can also be applied in various aerodynamic settings such as fan and propeller blades, airplanes, and surfboards. The incorporation of nature-inspired designs holds significant potential for optimizing performance across a range of applications.
