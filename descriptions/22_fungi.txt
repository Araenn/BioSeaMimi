Fungi stand out as unique and vital contributors to the delicate balance of Earth's ecosystem, serving as nature's efficient recyclers by breaking down waste and returning it to the cycle, facilitating the growth and flourishing of new life. In the face of the substantial amount of waste generated by humans, encompassing both organic and inorganic components, researchers at Biohm have made significant strides.
Biohm has successfully crafted a heat-insulating panel, outperforming traditional insulation materials, using myceliumâ€”the vegetative part of the fungus. Not only does this material exhibit superior performance, but it is also entirely biodegradable
