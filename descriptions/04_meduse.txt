Nanoparticles from materials used in electronic components or cosmetics persist in the environment and thus in the bodies of animal species. The mucus of jellyfish, such as the ctenophore Mnemiopsis, can filter nanoparticles and micropollutants from water and has inspired the development of a synthetic hydrogel by Inserm and IMBE at Aix-Marseille University. It is composed of a very dense network of oligosaccharide and peptine-type molecules. This filtering system could also facilitate the recovery of particles often made of noble materials such as gold, silver, or titanium.
