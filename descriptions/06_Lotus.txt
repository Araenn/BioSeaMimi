The superhydrophobicity of lotus leaves, rice leaves, reeds, rose petals, cabbage flowers, butterfly wings, or cicada wings, and the shell of certain beetles like the Namib Desert darkling beetle, thanks to their microstructured surface that traps air, serves as an example for antifouling coatings. For example, the shell of this beetle alternates between hydrophilic and hydrophobic zones to grow and direct water droplets to the insect's mouth in the Namib Desert.
