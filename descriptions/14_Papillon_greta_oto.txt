The Greta oto butterfly has transparent wings for camouflage and self-cleaning and hydrophobic properties thanks to a pillar-shaped nanostructure covering its wings. These structures prevent light reflections. The composition of these wings has inspired an ultra-transparent solar panel coating that allows for greater light absorption (only 5% of reflected rays compared to 30% for standard solar panels) and thus better electricity production.
