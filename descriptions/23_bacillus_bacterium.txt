Concrete, a cornerstone of construction, is integral to many aspects of our world. However, like everything else, it degrades over time, resulting in tens of billions of dollars spent globally each year on repairing damaged concrete. But what if concrete could heal itself, much like the human body? This innovative solution comes from Hendrik Marius Jonkers, who discovered rock-dwelling, limestone-producing bacillus bacteria.
These bacteria remain dormant within the concrete. When a crack forms, exposing the bacteria to moisture and air, they become active and generate limestone, effectively sealing the breach. Remarkably, these bacteria boast a lifespan of 200 years. This self-healing concrete has the potential to save billions of dollars and considerable time, offering a transformative solution to the persistent challenge of concrete deterioration.
