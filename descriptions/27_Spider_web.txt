Humans have been using glass for at least 5000 years, appreciating its durability, luxury, and transparency, which serves as a strong barrier against the environment. While the transparency of glass is valued, it has proven to be hazardous for the hundreds of millions of birds colliding with buildings and skyscrapers that they can't detect. Arnold Glas sought a solution to this issue, and it turns out that nature had already addressed this problem over 50 million years ago.
Spiders, too, have a vested interest in preventing birds from colliding with their webs, as birds are too large to be caught in them. Spiders have evolved to incorporate UV-reflective silk strands in their webs. Inspired by this natural solution, ORNILUX Bird Protection Glass has been developed. This glass features a UV-reflective coating that is detectable by birds, allowing them to navigate safely around it and mitigating the risk of collisions with buildings.
