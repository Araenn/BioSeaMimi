Inspired by the "bumpy" fins of humpback whales, the team led by Frank Fish, Stephen Dewar, and Philip Watts has developed turbine blades with three-dimensional bumps on their leading edges. 

These bumps alter the airflow, significantly enhancing aerodynamic performance and reducing noise in wind turbines. 

This biomimetic approach draws from nature to improve the efficiency and acoustics of wind energy technology.
