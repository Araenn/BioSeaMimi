One of our planet's most incredible abilities is to absorb carbon. Carbon capture as it is called. From large forest ecosystems to massive oceans to the dazzling variety of organisms which use carbon to make various components. In the oceans, organisms form carbonates. In other areas, certain bacteria convert them into a bioplastic called PHB. PHB is a biodegradable (compostable) compound which gives out CO2 and Water as the byproduct when degraded. It can also be used to make new plastic alternative materials after finishing its current product lifecycle. In the ocean, such materials take 1-3 years to biodegrade.
