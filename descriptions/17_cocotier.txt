Coconut trees are frequently subjected to extreme winds, yet it is rare to find one of these trees or even their branches spread on the ground. This resistance is due to the flexible and light structure of the trunk and the ability of the branches to deform. In case of strong wind, the tree bends in the direction of the airflow, and the branches gather and align with it. The behavior of this tree has inspired engineer-researchers at the University of Virginia who have developed ultra-light segmented rotors capable of deforming (SUMR) for offshore wind turbines. Their mass is 25% lower than that of traditional wind turbines, and their blades are 60% less stressed.
