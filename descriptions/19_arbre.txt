WATER Labs has introduced iThrone, a groundbreaking solution inspired by the evaporation process in trees, designed to eliminate human waste without relying on energy or plumbing. This innovative system mimics the evapotranspiration process observed in trees and leaves. Operating as a low-cost and portable toilet, iThrone efficiently evaporates 95% of sewage through a non-porous membrane bag. This bag only permits water to escape as a gas, eliminating the need for plumbing or additional water sources. The technology holds significant promise for addressing sanitation challenges in critical areas such as refugee camps and resource-scarce regions.
