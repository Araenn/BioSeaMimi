Biome Renewables has developed PowerCone, a wind turbine accessory inspired by the shape of samaras optimized for air flows to remain attached along their "wings": the wind speed needed to set the samara in rotation is lower. PowerCone also draws inspiration from the kingfisher's beak, a bird capable of diving into the water almost without a splash, to reduce air leaks at the rotor axis by improving air distribution to the blades. This improvement results in up to a 13% increase in the annual energy produced by a wind turbine, a significant reduction in noise, and a decrease in stress on the blades.
