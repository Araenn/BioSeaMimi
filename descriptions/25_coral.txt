The cement industry is a major contributor to global CO2 emissions, accounting for 8% of the total. A significant portion of these emissions, around 60%, is generated during the calcination process, where limestone is extracted from quarries and processed. In contrast, corals in the sea have been creating robust and stable materials by utilizing CO2 present in water to form metal carbonates. Scientists at Blue Planet have developed a method to produce carbonate aggregates, emulating the corals, without the need to extract CO2 from the air. This innovative approach eliminates the high energy consumption associated with separating CO2 from the air and results in a carbon-negative byproduct that can be utilized by the cement industry
