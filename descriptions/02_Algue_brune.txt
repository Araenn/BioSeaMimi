The red algae Delisea pulchra possesses halogenated furanones that limit the growth of bacteria on its surface, making it a source of inspiration for antifouling strategies. Similarly, the brown algae Taonia atomaria and marine algae in general, whether brown, green, or red, produce compounds with varied structures, such as fatty acids, lipoproteins, alkaloids, lactones, steroids, terpenoids, or pyrroles that are antimicrobial, anti-algal, and anti-larva.
