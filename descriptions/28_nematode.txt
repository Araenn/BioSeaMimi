Our current agricultural practices exemplify the law of diminishing returns, with industry giants promoting increased use of fertilizers and pesticides. Unfortunately, this approach is degrading the natural quality of the soil, leading to significant runoff into water streams. Moreover, consumers are expressing growing concerns about the overuse of chemicals in agriculture, especially when it comes to potential residues on their food.
In addressing the crop pest issue organically, Pheronym Inc has turned to nematodes, abundant microscopic organisms, and tapped into their communication systems. Nematodes are well-known for their natural role in maintaining soil health. Researchers have deciphered the pheromone signals of nematodes, promoting the activity of beneficial nematodes while inhibiting harmful parasitic nematodes. This approach has proven beneficial for bee health as well, all achieved without resorting to toxic chemicals. It represents a more sustainable and environmentally friendly method for managing soil health and crop pests.
