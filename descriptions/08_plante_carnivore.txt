Extremely slippery nano-ridged coatings are inspired by carnivorous plants like Nepenthes, which have interesting super-hydrophilic surfaces for the development of antifouling strategies. This surface, present in the digestive urn neck, traps a thin layer of water in tiny structures, creating a slippery surface for insects that eventually fall into the digestive part of the urn.
