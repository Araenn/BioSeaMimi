Traditionally, wind turbines are spaced widely apart to avoid disrupting each other's wind flow, which can decrease the overall efficiency of a wind farm. Drawing inspiration from schools of fish, scientists noticed that fish swim closely together without disturbing the water around them. This observation led to the development of vertical axis wind turbines. When positioned closely and at specific angles to each other, these turbines actually enhance each other's efficiency. This concept leverages the same principles that fish use to propel themselves forward, utilizing the water vortices created by neighboring fish. Implementing this approach allows for more power to be derived from a smaller area, optimizing the efficiency of wind energy generation.
